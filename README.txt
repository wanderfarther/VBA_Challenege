The script collects the ticker of each stock, the yearly change from the opening price to the closing price for each stock, the percentage change from the opening to closing price for each stock, and the total stock volume of each stock.

It does this for each worksheet in the workbook.

It then goes through and find the stock with the greatest percentage increase, least percentage increase, and the greatest total volume of a stock and displays that on the screen. 

I used this website to get the calculations for percentage change https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/percentage-change.asp#:~:text=How%20Do%20I%20Calculate%20Percentage,multiply%20that%20number%20by%20100.
